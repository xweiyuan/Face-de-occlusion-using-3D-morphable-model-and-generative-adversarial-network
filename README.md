# Face-de-occlusion
Face de-occlusion using 3d morphable model and generative adversarial network

## Feature
A novel method is proposed to restore de-occluded face images based on the use of 3DMM and generative adversarial network. Experiments shows the advantages of this method on challenging facial de-occlusion, 3D face reconstruction and face attibute editing.
